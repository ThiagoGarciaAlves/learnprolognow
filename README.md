I have been reading the online version of the book [Learn Prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=online).

This is just a repo of my solutions to the exercises and practical sessions at the end of each chapter. I only include the solutions that involve writing Prolog code, not the concept exercises or traces.

**Note:** Beware that I use the GNU Prolog compiler and sometimes make use of the built-in predicates, such as reverse/2, which will probably not work if you are using the SWI or SICStus compilers.  The GNU compiler is easy to install for Ubuntu users:

    $ sudo apt-get install gprolog

Feel free to peek at my solutions if you're stumped!  :)
